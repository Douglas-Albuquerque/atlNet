        <h1>Somehow I know
            That things are gonna change
            New boundaries on the way
            Like never were before
            Find a meaning to your life
            Healing whispers of the angels
            Bring the sunrise again

            New day shines, fallen angels will arise
            Nova Era brings the ashes back to life
            (Bring ashes back to life)
            All over now, all the pain and awful lies
            Angels will arise back to life

            Fresh winds of hope
            Has taken us ahead
            Forever is a place you have to keep in mind
            No way to limit our goals
            We'll find a reason to believe
            Facing Nova Era

            New day shines, fallen angels will arise
            Nova Era brings the ashes back to life
            (Bring ashes back to life)
            All over now, all the pain and awful lies
            Angels will arise back to life

            Come on, arise

            Find a meaning to your life
            No way to limit our goals
            Healing whispers of the angels bring the sunrise again

            New day shines, fallen angels will arise
            Nova Era brings the ashes back to life (all over now)
            All over now, sores in pain and awful lies
            Angels lead you through paradise

            Nova Era is the passage to your mind
            And forever you may find a better time
            Nova Era brings the angels back to life
            Life!</h1>
